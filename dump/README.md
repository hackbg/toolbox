# @hackbg/dump

This package is our JS (well, TS) implementation of
[brailledump by the amazing Justinne Tunney](https://justine.lol/braille/).
It uses Braille characters to print binary data legibly.

```typescript
import { brailleDump } from '@hackbg/dump'
console.log(brailleDump(/* some Uint8Array */))
```
